## Jigsaw Theorem

Multiple independent facts that interlock rationally — each explaining or necessitating the others — indicate a true underlying structure. Disconnected or contradictory facts suggest falsehood or missing information.

**Example:** The 2026 Epstein file release contains a drafted email that Jeffrey Epstein wrote for Bill Gates stating that Bill has likely contracted an STD from a woman he met up with during one of Jeffrey Epstein‘s parties.

It then goes on to say that he has likely given it to his wife Melinda Gates and should attempt to use drugs or antibiotics on his wife Without her knowledge to get rid of that STD.

Bill Gates denies this saying he has never gone to the island, has never met with any women and did not contract an STD from these meetings

**Core mechanics:**

- **Interlocking necessity**: Each piece must serve the others. Gates's STD explains Epstein's blackmail leverage; Epstein's email confirms he possessed that leverage; Gates's later denials contradict both the leverage and the email's existence.
- **Motivational coherence**: Rational actors act toward identifiable ends. Epstein gains nothing from fabricating specific blackmail against someone as powerful as Bill Gates. Gates gains everything from severing that narrative.
- **Explanatory economy**: The interlocking version requires no extraneous assumptions. The denial version requires positing Epstein as irrationally specific, Gates as coincidentally targeted by fiction, and an email drafting itself into existence.

**Boundary conditions:**

The theorem fails when "making sense" becomes a creative act which forces pieces together that merely *can* fit rather than *must*. It succeeds when removing any single piece collapses the entire structure.

**Relation to existing frameworks:**

- Arkham's Razor: prefers fewest assumptions
- Jigsaw Theorem: prefers mutually necessitating assumptions

They converge when the simplest explanation also interlocks most completely. They diverge when simplicity leaves explanatory gaps that only interlocking complexity fills
